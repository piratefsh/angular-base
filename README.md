# Angular App Base

How I usually start an Angular app.

## Tools

* Bower
* SASS (including Susy and Breakpoint)

## Setup

* Clone this repo and cd into it
* Install npm and bower packages
* Run `grunt dependencies` to package Angular dependencies (one time)
* Run `grunt watch` and `compass watch` to watch for changes
